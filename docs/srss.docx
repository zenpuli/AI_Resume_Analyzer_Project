ApnaDukaan – Empowering Local Retail through AI‑Driven Commerce

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this SRS is to formally specify all functional and non‑functional requirements of the ApnaDukaan system, so that developers, testers, and stakeholders share a clear, common understanding of what needs to be built. It will guide design, implementation, testing, and maintenance activities throughout the project lifecycle.
1.2 Scope 
ApnaDukaan is a web‑based e‑commerce platform that enables neighborhood grocery and retail shops to establish an online presence and serve customers digitally. The system supports customer browsing and secure checkout, shopkeeper inventory and pricing management, delivery tracking, and AI‑driven chatbot assistance with recommendations and dynamic store ratings. The platform is structured as a three‑interfaced system managing the end‑to‑end supply chain for local commerce.
